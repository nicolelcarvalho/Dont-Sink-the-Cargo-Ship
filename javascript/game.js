// Global Variables 
	// Store the displayed random number in a variable. The random number should be between 19 - 120.
	// Store each of the four crystals' random numbers in each of their own variables. Each crystal should have a random hidden value between 1 - 12.
	// Create a total score variable that adds up each of the four crystals variables.. as an array?
	// Create a variable for wins. 
	// Create a variable for losses. 



// Start the game: The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.


// When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score.
// Target the ID's of the elements from the HTML page and create an onclick function. 
// Your game will hide this amount until the player clicks a crystal.
// When they do click one, update the player's score counter.
// Write the total score variable to the HTML div that displays the player's total score. 


// Compare the current value of the total score variable with the random number variable. 
// If the player's score match the random number variable, the player wins and wins increases by 1. 
// If the players score is greater than the random number, the player loses and losses increases by 1. 


// The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.
// When the game begins again, the player should see a new random number. 
// All the crystals will have four new hidden values. 
// All counters reset to 0 except for wins and losses.
